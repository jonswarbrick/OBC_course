% .^  Array power.
%    Z = X.^Y denotes element-by-element powers. X and Y must have
%    compatible sizes. In the simplest cases, they can be the same size or
%    one can be a scalar. Two inputs have compatible sizes if, for every
%    dimension, the dimension sizes of the inputs are either the same or one
%    of them is 1.
% 
%    C = POWER(A,B) is called for the syntax 'A .^ B' when A or B is an
%    object.
