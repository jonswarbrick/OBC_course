% FIGURE Create figure window.
%    FIGURE, by itself, creates a new figure window, and returns
%    its handle.
%  
%    FIGURE(H) makes H the current figure, forces it to become visible,
%    and raises it above all other figures on the screen.  If Figure H
%    does not exist, and H is an integer, a new figure is created with
%    handle H.
% 
%    GCF returns the handle to the current figure.
% 
%    Execute GET(H) to see a list of figure properties and
%    their current values. Execute SET(H) to see a list of figure
%    properties and their possible values.
