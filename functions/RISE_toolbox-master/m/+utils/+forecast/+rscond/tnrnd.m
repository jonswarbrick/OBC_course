% TRND   Random arrays from Student's t distribution.
%    R = TRND(V) returns an array of random numbers chosen from Student's t
%    distribution with V degrees of freedom.  The size of R is the size of
%    V.
% 
%    R = TRND(V,M,N,...) or R = TRND(V,[M,N,...]) returns an M-by-N-by-...
%    array.
% 
%    The t distribution with one degree of freedom is also known as the
%    Cauchy distribution.
